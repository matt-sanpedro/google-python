# If Statements

### Terminology
__Branching__: the ability of a program to alter its execution sequence

### Concepts
- body of if block will only execute when the condition evaluates to true; otherwise it's skipped
- when a return statement is executed, the function exits, so that the code that follows doesn't get executed
- elif blocks are only checked if the first if block is NOT executed (or evaluated to False)
