# Functions
- provide parameters when defining function name
- must indent after each subsequent line below function name
- function identation must be consistent throughout code

### Terminology
__None__: a special data type in Python used to indicate that things are empty or that they returned nothing
__Self-Documenting__: written in a way that's readable and doesn't conceal its intent
__Return Value__: the value or variable returned as the end result of a  function
__Parameter (argument)__: a value passed into a function for use within the function
__Refactoring Code__ a process to restructure code without changing functionality

### Code Style
- names of variables and functions reflect their purpose
- use comments to explain comments and notes to future programmers
