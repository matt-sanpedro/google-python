# Basic Python Syntax

### Terminology
__type function__: use the "type" function in python to tell what data type
__variables__: names that we give to certain values in our programs
    * when created, computer allocates memory to store the data
    * naming restrictions - do not use keyqords or functions that Python reserves
    * do not use spaces and must start with a letter or underscore (_)
    * can only use following characters: letters, numbers, and underscores
    * Python is case-sensitive, the following are different variables: name, Name, and NAME
__assignment__: the process of storing a value inside a variable
__expression__: a combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated
__implicit conversion__: the interpreter automatically converts one data type into another
    * when performing mathematical operations with "float" and "integer" data types
__explicit conversion__: call the data type in python to convert manually
    * examples of Python reserved functions include: str(), int(), and float()

### Skill Group 1:
- Use the assignment operator =  to assign values to variables
- Use basic arithmetic operators with variables to create expressions
- Use explicit conversion to change a data type from float to string

### Skill Group 2:
- Output multiple string variables on a single line to form a sentence
- Use the plus (+) connector or a comma to connect strings in a print() function
- Create spaces between variables in a print() function

### Skill Group 3:
- Resolve TypeError caused by a data type mismatch issue
- Use an explicit conversion function

### Skill Group 4:
- Resolve a ZeroDivisionError caused by an attempt to divide by 0
