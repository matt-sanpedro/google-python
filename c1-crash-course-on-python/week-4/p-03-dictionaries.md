# Dictionaries

### Terminology
- __items()__: dictionary method returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary
    * first element is key and second is the value
- __keys()__: dictionary method returns keys from the dictionary
- __values()__: dictionary method returns values from the dictionary
- __set__: data type used when you want to store a bunch of elements and be certain that they're only present once
    * elements of set must be immutable

### Concepts
- utilized as key/value pairs
- use curly braces "{}" to define content
- dictionaryies are mutable, can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary
- keys in a dictionary must be an immutable data type
    * numbers
    * booleans
    * strings
    * tuples

### Dictionaries vs. Lists
- list ideal for storing a list of ip addresses to ping
