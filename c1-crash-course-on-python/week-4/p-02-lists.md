# Lists

### Concepts
- lists are mutable unlike strings
- In Python, lists and strings are similar, both are examples of sequences of data
- best practice to add descriptive comments to list comprehensions used in code

### Terminology
- __Mutable__: objects that can be modified (or mutated) after they're created, and transform into other data or variables
- __Strings__: sequences of characters, and are immutable
- __Lists__: sequences of elements of any type, and are mutable
- __Tuples__: sequences of leements of any type, that are immutable
    * position of the elements have meaning (unlike lists which are unordered)
    * specified in Python using parentheses instead of square brackets
    * is the data type when a function returns multiple values
- __List comprehensions__: let us create new lists based on sequences or ranges
