# For Loop
- iterates over a sequence of values

### When to use for loops
- a range of numbers will start with value of 0 by default
- the list of numbers generated will be one less than the given value
- useful when there is a sequence of elements that you want to iterate

### Concepts
- range of numbers will start at 0
- list of numbers generated will be one less than the provided value

### The __range()__ function
- can accept 1-3 parameters, example: range(start, stop, step)
- uses a set of indices that point to integer values, which start at the number 0

### Common errors in for loops
- integers are NOT iterable
- strings ARE iterable
