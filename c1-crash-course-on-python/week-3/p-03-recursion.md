# Recursion

### Terminology
- __Recursion__: the repeated application of the same procedure to a smaller problem

### When to use recursion
- tackles complex problems by reducing the problem to a simpler one
- in programming, recursion is a way of doing a repetitive task by having a function call itself
- in Python, by default a recursive function can only be called 1000 times

### Concepts
- a recursive function must include a recursive case and a base case
