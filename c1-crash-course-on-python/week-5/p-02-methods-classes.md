# Methods and Classes

### Terminology
- __Methods__: functions that operate on the attributes of a specific instance of a class
- __Instance variables__: variables that have different values for different instances of the same class
- __Self__: represents the instance the method is being executed on
- __Docstring__: a brief text that explains what something does

### Concept: Classes and Instances
- Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class.
- Each variable of a specific class is an instance or object.
- Objects can have attributes, which store information about the object.
- You can make objects do work by calling their methods.
- The first parameter of the methods (self) represents the current instance.
- Methods are just like functions, but they can only be used through a class.

### Concept: Special Methods
- Special methods start and end with __.
- Special methods have specific names, like __init__ for the constructor or __str__ for the conversion to string.
