# Object-Oriented Programming
- A flexible, powerful paradigm where classes represent and define concepts, while objects are instances of classes

### Terminology
- __Attributes__: characteristics associated to a type (flavor and color of an apple)
- __Methods__: functions associated to a type (cut or bite into a apple)
- __dir()__: function to print all the attributes and methods of an object
- __help()__: function to view the documentation for corresponding class
- __Dot notation__: lets you access any of the abilities the object might have (methods) or information it might store (attributes)

### Concepts
- all things in Python are objects including numbers, strings, lists, and numbers
- when a list is created in Python, an object is created which is an instance of the list class
- each string used in Python is a different instance of the string class
- in Python, can use dir("") and help("") to get more information on methods
