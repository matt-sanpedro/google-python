# Introduction
- geared for IT
- write simple programs and their role in automation
- how python interacts with os
- GitHub to manage version of code

### Introduction to Programming
__syntax__: rules for how each instruction is written
__semantics__: actual meaning of statements or the effect the instructions have
__script__: a program that's short, simple, and can be written very quickly

### Introduction to Automation
__automation__: the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically
    * automating tasks allows you to focus on projects that are a better use of your time
    * let computer do boring stuff for you

#### Artificial Intelligence
- basic automation is not the same as artificial intelligence
- AI involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through machine learning

#### Introduction to Python
__interpreter__: the program that reads what's in the recipe and translates it into instructions for your computer to follow
__functions__: pieces of code that perform a  unit of work
__keywords__: reserved words that are used to construct instructions (if, while, or for)
- once you learn Python there are many similarities to other programming languages
