# Regular Expressions (Regex, Regexp)

### Terminology
- __Regular Expressions__: allow us to search a text for strings matching a specific pattern
- __Command line tools for regex__: grep, sed, awk
- __Reserved characters__: advanced matching for regex
    * __.__: a dot matches any character
    * __^__: beginning of line
    * __$__: end of line


### Basic matching with grep
- case-sensitive implemented as: grep [search term] [file(s)]
- case-insensitive implemented as: grep -i [search term] [file(s)]
